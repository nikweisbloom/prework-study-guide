        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>Metadata, used in the head element, is the data about the webpage that the browser uses to serve the webpage to different users. </li>
     <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
     <li>In the body you can find but not limited to: Headers, Images, Paragraphs, and Lists such as this one.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
          <li>As in the name, this language is primarily for looks and the different styling techniques used.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the OUTSIDE of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content INSIDE an element.</li>
          <li>There are three different techniques in styling with CSS</li>
          <li>The first being Inline CSS which are quick permanent changes, such as using the style attribute to change the color of a header.</li>
          <li>The second being Internal CSS style sheets, where the changes are made in the head and only apply to that specific page.</li>
          <li>Finally, the third being External CSS style sheets, which allows developers to keep all their CSS techniques in a separate file. Making the design changes ultimately easier.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a free version control system that allows developers in different areas to collaborate on one piece together.</li>
          <li>Allows the ability for developers to go back and revisit or revert to previous codes if problems are discovered.</li>
          <li>When using Git, every command starts with 'git'.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what current branch one is working on.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is a programming language used to provide logic and interactivity amongst websites.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>A common variable one will use in JavaScript would be 'const', as it's key in the early stages to declare what your variables are.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>The Control flow is important as JavaScript only reads from the top to bottom. So make sure everything is in order when inserting different code.</li>
          <li>An Array would be a singluar variable that is used to hold a group of data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>The main two requirements for JavaScript functions would be: How you define the function, and then what you end up Calling your function.</li>
