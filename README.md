# Prework Study Guide Website

## Description

The reason for creating this was to learn the basics of creating a website or application by understanding further and using the topics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. By building this project I have furthered my education towards the specific topics mentioned earlier. I wanted to test myself by putting myself in an uncomfortable situation to further my learning. By doing so, I am much more comfortable navigating through my computer via the terminal. Along with the fact that I learned and put to use several programming languages. On top of that, I now understand how to create and transfer information to and from Git.

## Usage

Each section of the Website contains information about the topics discussed, such as HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. If one were to inspect and open up the DevTools on the page, you could see that JavaScript is currently running. By looking through the Website, it will show the different topics discussed so it's easier for the user to choose what to study first.
